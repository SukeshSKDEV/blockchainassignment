// 10. In which scenarios would you use synchronous code instead of asynchronous code
// Answer : Synchronous code is used when we need to perform operation one at a time, when the first code is completed, then next code is unblocked.
// While in asynchronous code, we can perform another task before the previous task is over. In this way we can perform multiple requests at a time.
