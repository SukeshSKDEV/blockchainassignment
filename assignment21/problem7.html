    <h1>Chainlink (blockchain)</h1>
    <p>Chainlink is a decentralized blockchain oracle network built on Ethereum</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Chainlink was created in 2017 by Sergey Nazarov and Steve Ellis,[6] who co-authored a white paper introducing the
        Chainlink protocol and network with Cornell University professor Ari Juels the same year.[1] Chainlink acts as a
        "bridge" between a blockchain and off-chain environments.[7] The network, which services smart contracts, was
        formally launched in 2019.[6]</p>
    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>Chainlink's decentralized oracle network is an open-source technology infrastructure that allows any blockchain
        to securely connect to off-chain data and computation resources. The network nodes fetch, validate, and deliver
        data from multiple sources onto blockchains to execute smart contracts.</p>
    <h2>Link token</h2>
    <p>Node operators are compensated with the network's native cryptocurrency, LINK.[12] Chainlink's LINK token is an
        ERC677 token.</p>
